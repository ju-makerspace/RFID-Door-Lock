# RFID Door Lock using Arduino
> Smart door locking system using **Arduino** and **RFID sensor**
# Working
This works in a very simple way whenever you bring your RFID card near to the RFID sensor it will automatically detect the UID (unique identification number) of the card and it will give access to the door and it will open the lock if you try with some other RFID card then it will deny your entry.
